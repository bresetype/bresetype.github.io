        <p>Hi, I’m Alex Blattmann — a Swiss type designer, font developer, and typographer.</p>
        <p>With over two decades of experience in Print, Typography, and Type Design, I’ve developed a deep passion for education in typography and type, building knowledge bases, and optimizing modern font development workflows.</p>
        <p>From 2012 to 2024, I worked as a font developer and team manager at Dalton Maag, where I helped shape the visual language and type systems of some of the world’s most recognized brands, including Amazon, DHL, Facebook, FedEx, HP, Nokia, and Oracle. I’ve developed custom, multi-script typefaces that reach readers and users globally.</p>

        <p>I’ve also shared my expertise as a lecturer and lead workshops at institutions like ECAL Master Type Design, SFGZ, Winchester School of Art, working with students of all levels to inspire and educate in the field of type design and typography.
        <p>Say hello or follow along! <br />I’m always open to collaboration and would love to hear from you — whether you’re interested in working together or just curious about my projects.<br /></p>
